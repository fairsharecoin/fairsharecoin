# FairShareCoin

One coin. One person. Forever.

FairShareCoin (FSC) is a radically fair digital value system.  
Each real human can receive exactly one coin — no more, no less.  
No mining. No fees. No inflation. Just peer-to-peer value.

## Principles

- One FSC per unique person  
- Identity is verified once via passport (ICAO standard)  
- Wallets must receive FSC from a verified user before they can be used  
- Anonymous behavior is allowed after issuance — not before  
- Upon death, coins become inactive (deflation by nature)  
- Wallets can be recovered if ID is updated or lost
