# Founder's Statement

FairShareCoin (FSC) is more than software — it is a principle.

Each person on Earth receives one coin, and only one.  
This design exists to challenge imbalance, remove privilege, and return value to individuals.  
There is no mining, no interest, no inflation. No transaction fees.  
Fairness is enforced by design, not by authority.

## Philosophy

FSC exists to represent **human equality** at a global scale.

- No person can mint more than one FSC
- No entity can mine or accumulate advantage by early access
- No coins are reissued after death
- No person is denied access due to geography, wealth, or politics

## Forks and Derivatives

The codebase is MIT licensed — forks are legally allowed.

However, **any derivative system that violates the one-person-one-coin principle, introduces fees, or centralizes control does not represent FairShareCoin** and must not imply association.

This is a free idea — but it is not a neutral one.

## Purpose

This project is designed to last for generations.  
It may outlive its founders, contributors, and original platforms.

Let it remain fair, minimal, and human-centered — forever.
