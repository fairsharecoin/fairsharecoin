# Contributing to FairShareCoin

Thank you for your interest in FairShareCoin (FSC).  
This project is built slowly, carefully, and without financial incentives.  
If you're here, it's because you believe in the idea — not because you expect payment.

## What This Project Is

FairShareCoin is a radically fair digital value system.  
It is not a startup, not a company, and not a grant-funded initiative.  
It is a long-term public protocol — and contributions reflect that.

- No one gets paid for contributing  
- There are no deadlines  
- Progress may take days, weeks, or years  
- Stability, simplicity, and fairness are prioritized over speed

## Ways You Can Contribute

We welcome help in any of the following areas:

- Translations of key content (starting with the website and pseudocode)
- Improvements to documentation (whitepaper, technical notes, clarity)
- Development suggestions, tests, or implementations
- Outreach materials or quiet advocacy
- Philosophical or technical feedback via issues or pull requests

If you're unsure where to begin, open a GitHub issue or email us at:

## Alignment

Before contributing, please make sure your work supports the core vision:

- One coin per person — no exceptions  
- No mining, no fees, no inflation  
- Identity-backed issuance, privacy-respecting usage  
- Long-term fairness over short-term gain  
- No central control, no privileged access

If your idea challenges these principles, please discuss it first via a GitHub issue.

## Thank You

FSC is open to all who believe in fairness by design.  
Even small contributions — a sentence, a thought, a translation — can shape something meaningful.
